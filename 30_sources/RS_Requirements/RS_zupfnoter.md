# Introduction

Zupfnoter is an attempt to implemente a tool to create music sheets for
"Table Harp" (http://Table Harp-harfen.de) respectively "Zauberharfe"
(http://www.musik-im-spiel.de).

Basic approach in for these instruments is, that the music sheet is
placed on the instrument such that the particular note and the string
are visually connected.

The following example illustrates the approach.

![Example Notation][]Â 

This document describes the initial requirements for "Zupfpnoter"; Basic
approach is

-   use as commandline tool
-   apply "abc-Notation and convert it to Table Harp Noten"
