module Harpnotes

  # The music model that is transformed (layouted) to something drawable
  #
  # =Terminology
  #
  # - *beat*: denotes the start time of a note. So the entire song
  #   is divided into beats (as the musician counts). Beats are mainly
  #   used to determine the vertical position of a Playable in the harp sheet
  #
  # - *beat_map*: a mapping of playables to the beats of the the music.
  #
  # - *beat_layout*: a mapping between the bats of the music and the beats shown in the sheet.
  #   basically it is an approach to vertically compress the sheet.
  #
  # - *Flowline*: a representation of the flow of the music. Flowlines connect notes
  #
  # - *Jumpline*: an indicator of jumps within the piece. The music continues at then end
  #   of the jumpline
  #
  # - *Syncline*: an indicator for notes to be played simultaneously. They synchronize
  #   two voices
  #
  #
  #
  # =Basic concept
  #
  #  Song -> Staff* -> Voice* -> MusicEntity*
  #
  # 1. Music is denoted as Song
  # 2. Staff: Song consists of Staffs. Staffs may be printed on the same sheet with synchronized beats
  #    but without Synclines
  # 3. Voice: A Staff consists of multiple voices. Voices are printed with synclines
  # 4. MusicEntity: A Voice is represented as a squence (Array) of MusicEntities. This can be Plaaybles
  #    but also other entis required to specify the music
  # 5. Playable < MusicEntitiy - an entity which is actually played
  #
  # 6. Note: Measures are not modelled as containers ...
