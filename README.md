-   to run from local filesystems
    -   run `rake build`
    -   open `30_sourcs/SRC_Zupfnoter/index.html` in your webbrowser

-   to run from a local webserver

# Zupfnoter conventions in abc code

Zupfnoter tries to use ABC as close as possible. It does not add new
syntax but applies to some conventions. These conventions reflect to

1.  comments

    comments starting with `%%%%hn.` have a specific interpetation

2.  annotations

    Annotations starting with one of `:`, `@`, `!`, `#` have a specific
    interpretation

The specific conventions in detail are as follows:

1.  Jumps and repetitions

    This is done using anotations which is text in double quotes before
    a note. The target of the "jump" is denoted as "\^:target", while
    the "jump" is dentoed as "\^@target". Of course the same target can
    be part of multple jumps.

    You can control the position of the goto-line by adding a distance
    in halftones, e.g. "\^@target@3", "\^@target@-3"

2.  Repetitions can also be controlled by chords on the right repeat
    bar. In this case target is left empty. For example

        "^@@-3" :| 

    places the repetition line 3 halftones left of the end of the
    repetition.

3.  Control visualization of Voices Synchlines, Jumplines, Flowlines

    This is done using specific comments with JSON syntax

        %%%%hn.print {"t":"all",         "v":[1,2,3,4], "s": [[1,2],[3,4]], "f":[1,3], "j":[1]}
        %%%%hn.print {"t":"all",         "v":[1], "s": [[1,2],[3,4]], "f":[1,3], "j":[1]}
        %%%%hn.print {"t":"sopran, alt", "v":[1,2],     "s":[[1,2]],       "f":[1],   "j":[1,2]}
        %%%%hn.print {"t":"tenor, bass", "v":[1, 2, 3, 4],     "s":[[1, 2], [3,4]],       "f":[1],   "j":[1, 3]}
        %%score (T1 T2)  (B1 B2)

    t
    :   The title of the print

    v
    :   List of voices to be shown (it is an array of integer) from 1 to
        n denoting the voice index. Note that the voice index is
        basically the sequence of voices in the note preview. Therefore
        the %%score directive also influcnces the voice index.

    s
    :   List of synclines to be shown. It is an array of array integers
        denoting the voice pairs for which synchlines shall be drawn.

    f
    :   List of flowlines to be shown. It is an array of integers

    sf
    :   List of subflowlins to be shown. It is an array of intenters.
        Subflowlines are flowlines connecting notes which otherwise have
        no corresponding note in other displayed voices and therefore
        would appear as single notes lost in space (without anny
        connection).

    startpos
    :   the vertical position to start with the first note. It is an
        integer.

    j
    :   List of jumplines to be shown. It is an array of integers

    l
    :   List of voices to consider for vertical layout optimization.
        Defaults to the List specified by v

4.  control the position of the legend

        %%%%hn.legend {"pos": [10,10]}

    where parameter is the legend position in mm from top left

5.  augment the content of the legend

    The content of the legend is derived from the ABC metadata. You can
    append content to the particular lines by defineing an annotation
    with the same key. For example

        %%%%hn.annotation {"id": "K:", "pos": [-50,3], "text": "Original in F"}

    adds a note to the legend entry for "K:" which is the key of the
    music

6.  sheet based annotations

    %%%%hn.note {"pos": [10,10]. "text": "foobar", "style": "large"]

    Parameters:

    pos
    :   Position im mm from top left

    text
    :   The content of the note

    style
    :   Textstyle: "regular" | "large"

7.  Note bound annotations

    1.  you can define referrable annotations as

            %%%%hn.annotation {"id": "10", "pos": [-50,3], "text": "referenced annotation 10"}
            %%%%hn.annotation {"id": "11", "pos": [3,0], "text": "referenced annotation 11"}

    2.  Note bound annotations are also entered as annotations, for
        example:

        `"^!Fine@10,10"` adds the word "Fine" at 10,10 mm from the note.
        Default position is 3,0

        `"^#10@10,10"` adds the content of hn.annotation with id: "10"
        (see 1.) at position 10,10 from note.

8.  Lyrics

    Zupfnoter supports placement of lyrics by `w: lyrics` lines in ABC.
    You can control the position of lyrics by

        %%%%hn.lyrics {"pos": [50,50]}

    two beats) *done*
403. annotations *done*

## technology

501. MusicXml interface
502. Visualize the internal model for debugging purposes
503. Improved error handling

## Player

701. Emulate harpplayer *in progress*
702. Metronome

# Brainstorming

-   using shoes and atom_shell to make a standalone application
    https://github.com/wasnotrice/shoes-atom

# Result of initial evaluation

601. it is good to enter the stuff with two persons
602. good Visual feedback is essential
603. should be able to turn of some voices in oder to focus on the one
    currently entered
604. play from particular position onwards.
