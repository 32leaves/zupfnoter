# Zupfnoter conventions in abc code

## Zupfnoter abc conventions

Zupfnoter tries to use ABC as close as possible. It does not add new
syntax but applies to some conventions. These conventions reflect to

1.  comments

    comments starting with `%%%%zupfnoter.` have a specific interpetation

2.  annotations

    Annotations are entered as `"^..."`

    Annotations starting with one of `:`, `@`, `!`, `#`, `<`, `>` have a specific
    interpretation (for example `"^>"` shifts the note symbol right)
    
    `:`
    :   Target of a jump
    
    `@`
    :   Jump
    
    `!`
    :   Regular annotation
    
    `#`
    :   referenced annotation
    
    `>'
    :   shift note symbol right by half string distance
    
    `<'
    :   shift note symbol left by half string distance

The specific conventions in detail are as follows:

1.  Jumps and repetitions

    This is done using anotations which is text in double quotes before
    a note. The target of the "jump" is denoted as `"\^:target"`, while
    the "jump" is dentoed as `"\^@target"`. Of course the same target can
    be part of multple jumps.

    You can control the position of the goto-line by adding a distance
    in halftones, e.g. `"\^@target@3"`, `"\^@target@-3"`

2.  Repetitions can also be controlled by chords on the right repeat
    bar. In this case target is left empty. For example

        "^@@-3" :| 

    places the repetition line 3 halftones left of the end of the
    repetition.

## multi level configuration profiles

Zupfnoter uses a sophisticated configuration system to control any adjustable item in the produced harpnote sheets such as

* sheet dimensions
* line style
* size of notes
* annotations
* position of legend and lyrics

The configuration is represented as a hierarchy of key/value entities (Hiearchy of hashes). These entities
can be defined / redefined on various levels:

* the builtin defaults
* music level
* extract level

Configuration is appended to the abc - code separated by

```
%%%%zupfnoter.config
```

If the configuration section is missing, it is automatically inserted on first render. The configuration section 
is reformatted on every render action.


```JSON`

%%%%zupfnoter.config

{
 "produce": ["1", "2"]
}
```

This indicates that extract "1" and extract "2" shall be produced. The details of these views are taken from the default.

An more complex example is as follows:

```JSON

%%%%zupfnoter.config

{
  "produce"     : [1,2],
  "annotations" : {
    "refn" : {
      "pos"  : [20, 10],
      "text" : "referenced note",
      "id"   : "refn"
    }
  },
  "extract"     : {
    "0" : {"legend": {"pos": [283, 2], "spos": [322, 34]}},
    "1" : {
      "title"  : "Nur Sopran",
      "voices" : [1],
      "legend" : {"spos": [200, 28]}
    }
  },
  "$schema"     : "https://zupfnoter.weichel21.de/schema/zupfnoter-config_1.0.json",
  "$version"    : "1.0.0"
}
```

In this case we specifiy

* produce extract 1 and 2
* configure the position of legend and sublegend on extract 0
* change title, displayed voices and position of legend for extract 1

### configuration of an extract

the following fields apply to an extract:

title -> string
:   The title of the print, shown in the sublegend

voices -> array of numbers
:   List of voices to be shown (it is an array of integer) from 1 to
    n denoting the voice index. Note that the voice index is
    basically the sequence of voices in the note preview. Therefore
    the %%score directive also influcnces the voice index.

synchlines -> array of array of numbers
:   List of synchlines to be shown. It is an array of array integers
    denoting the voice pairs for which synchlines shall be drawn.

    example

    ```JSON
        "synchlines": [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    ```

flowlines - >array of numbers
:   List of flowlines to be shown. It is an array of integers

subflowlines -> array of numbers
:   List of subflowlins to be shown. It is an array of intenters.
    Subflowlines are flowlines connecting notes which otherwise have
    no corresponding note in other displayed voices and therefore
    would appear as single notes lost in space (without anny
    connection).

startpos -> number
:   the vertical position to start with the first note. It is an
    integer.

jumplines -> array of numbers
:   List of jumplines to be shown. It is an array of integers

layoutlines -> array of numbers
:   List of voices to consider for vertical layout optimization.
    Defaults to the List specified by `voices`

notes -> array of hashes (placeable text)
:   Hash of notes to be drawn on the output. Each note is a placeable text. the key is to be
    mantained manually.

    ```JSON
        "notes"        : {
          "1" : {"pos": [320, 0], "text": "", "style": "large"}
        },
    ```
nonflowrest -> boolean
:   if true: show rests in voices without flowlines

layout
:   This allows to change the layout parameters on the level of an extract


### the default configuration

    "produce"     : [0],

601. it is good to enter the stuff with two persons
602. good Visual feedback is essential
